# Vercel Deployment - Final Steps

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Local EdgeDB instance working ("Spandepong")
- ✅ EdgeDB Cloud instance created and running ("Ringpro/spandepong-prod") 
- ✅ Database schema migrated to cloud successfully
- ✅ Test data created in cloud database
- ✅ Application builds and deploys to Vercel successfully
- ✅ Fallback error handling implemented in database layer

## Next Steps to Complete Production Setup

### 1. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

**Required Action:** Add the EdgeDB connection string to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **Spandepong** project
3. Click **Settings** tab
4. Click **Environment Variables** in sidebar
5. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `EDGEDB_DSN`
   - **Value**: `edgedb://edgedb@spandepong-prod--ringpro.c-50.i.aws.edgedb.cloud:5656/edgedb`
   - **Environments**: Select ALL three:
     - ✅ Production
     - ✅ Preview  
     - ✅ Development

### 2. Trigger New Deployment

After adding the environment variable:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
   - OR -
3. Push any change to trigger automatic deployment:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure EdgeDB Cloud for production"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3. Verify Production Functionality

Once deployed with the environment variable:

1. Visit: https://spandepong.vercel.app
2. Navigate to **Tournaments** page
3. Click **Create New Tournament**
4. Try creating a tournament - should now work without "failed to create" errors
5. Verify data persists and is visible across page refreshes

## Current Cloud Database Status

**Cloud Instance**: `Ringpro/spandepong-prod`
**Host**: `spandepong-prod--ringpro.c-50.i.aws.edgedb.cloud:5656`
**Database**: Contains test data:
- 2 test players
- 1 test tournament ("Production Test Tournament")

## Expected Behavior After Configuration

**With EdgeDB Connection (Production Ready):**
- ✅ Tournaments created successfully
- ✅ Data persists between sessions  
- ✅ Build-time static generation with real data
- ✅ Fast page loads with pre-rendered content
- ✅ Full tournament management functionality

**Troubleshooting:**
If issues persist after environment variable setup:
1. Check Vercel function logs in dashboard
2. Verify environment variable is set in all environments
3. Ensure no typos in the DSN string
4. Test database connection from local with same DSN

## Security Notes

- ✅ No passwords in connection string (uses EdgeDB Cloud auth)
- ✅ TLS encryption enabled by default
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents data exposure
- ✅ Environment variables secure in Vercel
