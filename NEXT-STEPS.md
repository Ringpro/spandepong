# ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps - Spandepong Deployment

## What's Working âœ…
- âœ… Application builds successfully  
- âœ… EdgeDB Cloud database is set up with data
- âœ… Color contrast issues are fixed
- âœ… Code is deployed to Vercel (builds without database)

## What's Needed ðŸ”§

### 1. Configure Vercel Environment Variable

**URGENT**: The app is deployed but can't connect to the database because the `EDGEDB_DSN` environment variable is missing.

**Quick Fix:**
1. Go to **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Find your **Spandepong** project  
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add this variable:
   - **Name**: `EDGEDB_DSN`
   - **Value**: `edgedb://edgedb@spandepong-prod--ringpro.c-50.i.aws.edgedb.cloud:5656/edgedb`
   - **Environments**: Check ALL (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Save and wait for auto-deployment

### 2. Test Production
After the environment variable is set:
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Try creating a player
- Try creating a tournament
- Verify data persists

## Current Issue
The app shows "failed to create" errors in production because it can't connect to EdgeDB Cloud without the DSN environment variable.

## Expected Result
Once the environment variable is added, the production app should work exactly like your local development version.
