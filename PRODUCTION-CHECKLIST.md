## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

- [x] **Code Build Fix**: Resolved all TypeScript and ESLint errors
- [x] **Local Testing**: Application builds and runs successfully
- [x] **Git Setup**: All changes committed and pushed to repository
- [x] **Vercel Integration**: Automatic deployment from git repository configured
- [x] **Deployment Scripts**: Created EdgeDB Cloud deployment utilities
- [x] **Documentation**: Added comprehensive deployment guide
- [x] **Build Optimization**: Implemented robust EdgeDB connection handling
- [x] **Static Generation**: Pages now build successfully without database connection
- [x] **Graceful Fallbacks**: Application handles missing database during build gracefully
- [x] **Build Error Resolution**: Fixed Vercel build errors with graceful EdgeDB handling
  - ‚úÖ Added `force-dynamic` export to pages that access database
  - ‚úÖ Implemented `safeQuery` wrapper for database operations
  - ‚úÖ Created fallback EdgeDB client for build environments
  - ‚úÖ Fixed ESLint warnings and TypeScript errors

## üîÑ Next Steps (Choose Your Deployment Approach)

### Option A: Optimal Production Setup (Recommended)
For best performance with static generation and real data:

### 1. Create EdgeDB Cloud Instance
- [ ] Visit https://cloud.edgedb.com/
- [ ] Create new instance named `spandepong-prod`
- [ ] Select region closest to users
- [ ] Use EdgeDB version 5.4
- [ ] Copy the connection string

### 2. Deploy Schema to Cloud
- [ ] Run deployment script with your connection string:
  ```powershell
  .\scripts\deploy-to-cloud.ps1 "YOUR_CLOUD_CONNECTION_STRING"
  ```

### 3. Configure Vercel Environment (ALL Environments)
- [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Add `EDGEDB_DSN` with your cloud connection string
- [ ] **Important**: Select ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- [ ] Save the variable

### 4. Redeploy Application
- [ ] In Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy latest
- [ ] **Result**: Pages will be statically generated with real data (‚óã routes)

---

### Option B: Quick Deploy (Works Now)
Your current deployment will work immediately:

- [x] **Vercel Build**: ‚úÖ Succeeds without database
- [x] **Static Pages**: ‚úÖ Generated with empty data  
- [x] **Runtime**: ‚úÖ Will fetch data dynamically when database is added later
- [ ] Add EdgeDB connection later for dynamic data fetching

---
- [ ] Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

### 5. Verify Production Deployment
- [ ] Visit your production URL
- [ ] Test creating a tournament
- [ ] Add some players
- [ ] Start a tournament and play a few matches
- [ ] Verify data persists between sessions

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

```powershell
# Verify cloud connection (after setting up)
npm run edgedb:verify

# Check local development
npm run dev

# Manual deployment to cloud
.\scripts\deploy-to-cloud.ps1 "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

## üìä Production URLs

- **Vercel Project**: https://vercel.com/dashboard (your project)
- **EdgeDB Cloud**: https://cloud.edgedb.com/
- **Production App**: (will be provided by Vercel after deployment)

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Never commit production connection strings** to git
2. **Store sensitive data only in Vercel environment variables**
3. **Test thoroughly** before announcing to users
4. **Monitor** Vercel deployment logs for any issues

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify EdgeDB Cloud instance is running
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Use the verification script to test connections
