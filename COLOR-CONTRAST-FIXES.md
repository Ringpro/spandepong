# Color Contrast Fixes - Spandepong Tournament App

## Issue Resolved
Fixed color contrast problems where text was hard to read on black backgrounds and greyish text in white input fields was difficult to see in both light and dark modes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CSS Variables (`src/app/globals.css`)
- Added comprehensive CSS custom variables for light and dark modes
- Defined semantic color scheme:
  - `--card`: Background for cards and containers
  - `--card-foreground`: Text color for card content
  - `--input`: Background for form inputs
  - `--input-foreground`: Text color for inputs
  - `--muted`: Muted text color
  - `--primary`: Primary brand color
  - `--border`: Border colors
  - And more...

### 2. Custom Utility Classes
Added utility classes for consistent dark mode support:
- `.card` - Card backgrounds with proper borders
- `.input` - Form input styling with focus states
- `.btn-primary` - Primary button styling
- `.btn-secondary` - Secondary button styling
- `.text-muted` - Muted text color
- `.text-card-foreground` - Card text color
- `.border-default` - Semantic border color

### 3. Component Updates
Updated all components to use semantic color classes:

#### Players Page (`src/app/players/page.tsx`)
- Form inputs with proper contrast
- Player stats cards with dark mode support
- Table headers and data with readable colors
- Status indicators with dark mode variants

#### Tournament Pages
- **New Tournament** (`src/app/tournaments/new/page.tsx`): Form styling
- **Tournament List** (`src/app/tournaments/page.tsx`): Table and card styling
- **Homepage** (`src/app/page.tsx`): Hero section and feature cards

#### Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Navigation header with semantic colors

### 4. Dark Mode Enhancements
- Status badges now have explicit dark mode variants
- Input placeholders use muted colors for better readability
- Hover states work properly in both light and dark modes
- Focus rings use semantic colors

## Key Improvements

### Input Fields
- **Before**: Greyish text in white fields, hard to read
- **After**: High contrast text with proper background colors that adapt to theme

### Text Readability
- **Before**: Hard-to-read text on black backgrounds
- **After**: Proper contrast ratios for all text elements

### Status Indicators
- **Before**: Only light mode colors
- **After**: Adaptive colors for both light and dark modes

### Form Interactions
- **Before**: Poor focus states and contrast
- **After**: Clear focus rings and hover states

## Browser Testing
The application now provides excellent readability in:
- Light mode (white backgrounds)
- Dark mode (dark backgrounds)
- System preference auto-switching
- All form inputs and interactive elements

## Deployment
Changes automatically deploy to Vercel when pushed to GitHub main branch.

## Technical Implementation
Uses CSS custom properties with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for automatic theme detection and Tailwind CSS v4 utility classes for consistent styling.
